","paratransit_59_description":"Needles residents may struggle to find the right\r\ntransportation for routine errands, especially those\r\njust outside city limits, such as shopping, picking up\r\na prescription or getting to an appointment. Public\r\ntransportation does not meet this need.\r\nOwning and operating a car can be costly. A daily\r\ncar rental is expensive. Borrowing a vehicle has its\r\nown anxiety-laden risks. For local residents, the\r\nVVTA Enterprise CarShare Program in Needles is a\r\ngreat option.\r\nHOW IT WORKS\r\nThe program is for licensed drivers, 21 and older, who\r\nmay need a vehicle for just an hour or two, but don’t\r\nwant to borrow a car or rent one for the entire day. For\r\n$5 per hour, program members can reserve a wellmaintained\r\nvehicle.\r\nA Nissan Altima (sedan) and a Dodge Caravan (minivan)\r\nwill be stationed in the parking lot of Desert\r\nCommunities Federal Credit Union. Once you become\r\na VVTA Enterprise CarShare member you’ll be able\r\nto go online to reserve one of the vehicles for the date\r\nand time you need it.\r\nFor people who don’t have a bank account, debit\r\ncard, or credit card, the Sole PayCard is a great option.\r\nMoney is directly deposited on your card the day\r\nof payment.
